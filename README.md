#Scrum-tious

Scrum-tious is an app for people who desire organization in their kitchen.  They will be able to use this app to plan what meals they will have for the entire week and will be able to view a shopping list that includes all of the ingredients required for each of the week's recipes. This way anyone in the house can do the shopping and get everything necessary for the week. In homes without a designated cook, housemates can use this app to coordinate who is cooking which parts of each meal. In this way, even though not every person will be able to cook every dish, they will still be able to create delicious, complex meals by combining their strengths.

Unlike other apps, which provide individual shopping lists, recipes, reminders, or tips, this app will bring them all together into one convenient location.  The recipe book will be searchable and it will be easy to add a recipe to the weekly meal plan.  There will also be a place to add notes about modifications or cooking tips to a recipe. The reminder feature, which is not found in other cooking apps, will be very helpful for users with busy schedules so that they will not forget when to begin thawing or cooking food. In addition, there will be a shopping list comprising all of the ingredients from the week's recipes.

So whether we've got your support or not, we hope we've provided... Food for Thought.
